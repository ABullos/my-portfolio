                <p>During my twenty-one(21) years I have tried different types of hobbies. My first interest when I was younger was computers, I was fascinated with how computer works.
                    Hence, it was the one that push me to take the course I.T. Another skill of mine that I'm curently honing is baking. I would always see my aunt baking during my childhood days, and I was always her sous chef. No wonder I enjoyed baking and cooking food.
